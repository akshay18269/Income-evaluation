This project predicts whether a person’s income is above or below 50K using machine learning. 
The dataset includes demographic and work-related features such as age, education, occupation, and hours worked per week. 
The workflow covers loading the dataset, exploring its structure, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical features, and preparing the data for modeling. 
Models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting are trained and evaluated using accuracy and classification metrics. 
The repository contains the main Jupyter Notebook (income_evaluation.ipynb) and the dataset, allowing anyone to clone the project, install dependencies, and run the notebook to reproduce the results.
